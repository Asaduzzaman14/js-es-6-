What Are Cookies?

Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience.

Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection. This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer.


5/
localStorage VS sessionStorage

localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API.
 The difference is that with sessionStorage, the data is persisted only unti
 l the window or tab is closed. With localStorage,
  the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data. This tutorial features localStorage, but the syntax for sessionStorage is the same.

With this knowledge, you can now create, 
read, and update key/value pairs in localStorage.
